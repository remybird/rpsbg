Aseprite Importer currently has three very effective features.
When importing a file from Aseprite:
Import from layer as sprite
Import from tag as animation
Import from tileset in version 1.3 as sprite

Supported Unity versions: 2020, 2021, 2022.

To use these features, simply configure them in the Inspector by selecting the appropriate parameters. It is also very user-friendly for beginners as it eliminates the need for complex Texture/Sprite configuration.

It can also serve as a good basis for a workflow from art to programming.
Note: This plugin directly reads the Aseprite content without the need to configure the Aseprite path.
